### RTFM

RTFM stands for "Read The Fine Manual" (or a less polite variation). Itâ€™s a phrase often used in technical communities to suggest that a user consult the documentation or manual to find answers to basic or commonly-asked questions


### Shebang

A Shebang (#!) is the character sequence at the start of a script file that specifies the interpreter to execute the script. For example, #!/bin/bash indicates the script should be run using the Bash shell. It allows scripts to be executed as standalone programs.

Example:

#!/bin/bash

# A simple Bash script example
echo "Hello, World!"

# Display the current date and time
echo "The current date and time is: $(date)"

# List files in the current directory
echo "Files in the current directory:"
ls
